new change

little test

let me focus on using terraform to configure the azure iot simulated devices, 
I'll use kubernetes later on to store them in containers or something

get the containers to injest the iot data from somewhere else and maybe even a frontend container
to and orchestrate them using azure kubernetes. This way I won't have to spend time building containers.

^^ use this to simulate iot data

project i am doing:

Building a scalable messaging infrastructure using RabbitMQ: 

You can use RabbitMQ with Kubernetes to create a scalable and fault-tolerant messaging infrastructure. You can use Terraform to deploy RabbitMQ on Kubernetes and manage the desired state of RabbitMQ resources.




also I'll use github codespaces for this project, this is great!
honestly github codespaces would be perfect since I'll be doing everything on the cloud using terraform.

^^ I mean thats good but for now I'll just do coding in my local computer, its probably just easier, and I'll include the terraform code in the github actions file.


Use kubernetes in some way in this projects.

Use argoCD instead of github actions maybe



I'll use this tutorial basically: https://medium.com/microsoftazure/the-seeing-raspberry-pi-3d66afc4a536
^^ use terraform basically, show I know what I am doing



THIS WILL BE AN ENTIRELY AZURE CLOUD FOCUSED APP. NO NEED TO USE STREAMLIT OR ANY OTHER VENDOR NEUTRAL APP HERE.



THIS IS PROJECT NOW, AMAZING IDEA, azure vision service creates a description, then the description gets routed to dalle or midjourney, which then returns an image, (I don't think I wanna bother with streamlit for this one). All of this will be deployed using terraform.

dalle e api link: https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta



basically show off how familiar I am with azure cloud services with this project. Y'know configure a few networking stuff, maybe some frontend stuff as well, (use terraform to make all this possible), then like deploy this or something. Definitely include this in the resume.


The passwords and secrets and stuff will be stored in the azure key vault.


I'll use terraform to configure all the azure cloud stuff. And I'll use github actions to automatically set it up.

making changes testing

writing again
ONe more test

the conda environment for this is "machine"

testing one thing too

I'll need to install requirements.txt file here

I'll be using the custom vision thing to distinguish between different objects,
what kind of objects? I don't know yet, but I'll figure it out as this project 
progresses
